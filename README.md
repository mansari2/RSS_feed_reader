# RSS_feed_reader
Repo containing an RSS feed reader for terminal
## Introduction
Let's build an RSS feed reader! Most news websites, blogs, podcasts, maintain a RSS feed which gives real-time content updates. You'll build a tool for fetching and converting the feed with a given RSS feed URL. If you aren't familiar with RSS, here's a great introduction to how RSS feeds work.


## Requirements
The user can input a RSS feed URL.
The reader will display the title, description, and link of the original content.
For an extra challenge

The user can add more than one RSS feed URL.
Instead of using a RSS parser library, build the parser yourself!
Suggested Implementation
If you only want to practice working with RSS, you can implement this project in the terminal.

Wrap the code as a script
Get the input feed URL from console
Show the content in plain text
To get some additional practice with front-end development, you can work on this project instead to create a web page to display the parsed feed content.
